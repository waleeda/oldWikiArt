# WikiArt Mobile

This repository contains the original iOS project and an Android port.

* `WikiArt3.0` – iOS application written in Swift.
* `android` – Android port written in Kotlin.

The Android port now displays a list of featured paintings retrieved from the
WikiArt API with endless scrolling support powered by the Paging library.
