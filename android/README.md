# WikiArt Android Port

This is an initial Android port of WikiArt. The project includes a simple
Kotlin-based application with a single activity and placeholder layout.

To build the project, open the `android` directory in Android Studio or run
`gradle assembleDebug` from this folder (ensure the Android SDK and Kotlin
plugin are installed).
