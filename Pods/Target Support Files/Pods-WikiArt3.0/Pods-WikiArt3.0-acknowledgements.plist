nature, arising from or in any way related to your use of CanvasPop APIs. If you are a California
resident, you waive your rights under California Civil Code ¤ 1542, which states, "A general release
does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time
of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the
debtor." You understand that any fact relating to any matter covered by this release may be found to be
other than now believed to be true and you accept and assume the risk of such possible differences in
fact. In addition, you expressly waive and relinquish any and all rights and benefits which you may have
under any other state or federal statute or common law principle of similar effect, to the fullest
extent permitted by law.

any time with or without your consent. You may not assign the API Terms without CanvasPop's prior
written consent, and any unauthorized assignment by you shall be null and void.

portion shall be severed, and the remainder of the API Terms shall be given full force and effect.

(e) Attorneys' Fees. In the event any litigation is brought by either party in connection with these API
Terms, the prevailing party in such litigation shall be entitled to recover from the other party all the
reasonable costs, attorneys' fees and other expenses incurred by such prevailing party in the
litigation.

(f) No Waiver. Our failure to enforce any provision of these API Terms shall in no way be construed to
be a present or future waiver of such provision, nor in any way affect the right of any party to enforce
each and every such provision thereafter. The express waiver by us of any provision, condition or
requirement of these API Terms shall not constitute a waiver of any future obligation to comply with
such provision, condition or requirement.

(g) Notices. All notices given by you or required under these API Terms shall be in writing and
addressed to: CanvasPop, Inc., 800 Market St. Suite 600 San Francisco, CA 94102, ATTN: CEO.
